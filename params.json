{"name":"jgroups-raft","tagline":"Implementation of the Raft consensus protocol in JGroups","body":"### Welcome to jgroups-raft\r\nThe jgroups-raft project is a [Raft](https://raftconsensus.github.io/) implementation in [JGroups](http://www.jgroups.org). It is currently in its own repo because it'll move much faster than JGroups and I wanted to have the freedom to release versions in quick succession.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nManual: [https://github.com/belaban/jgroups-raft/blob/master/doc/manual/manual.adoc](https://github.com/belaban/jgroups-raft/blob/master/doc/manual/manual.adoc)\r\nNote that the manual can be generated locally. To do this, check out jgroups-raft and execute `ant manual`. The manual will be generated in the `build` directory.\r\nOn my todo list: to update the web page automatically with the generated manual...\r\n\r\n### Mailing list\r\nWe use Google groups for discussions: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jgroups-raft](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jgroups-raft)\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-5375409-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
