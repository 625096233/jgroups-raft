[[BuildingBlocks]]
== Building blocks

Similar to JGroups' building blocks, jgroups-raft also has building blocks, which provide additional functionality on
top of a `RaftHandle`. They are typically given a JChannel, create a `RaftHandle` and register themselves as
`StateMachine` with the handle. Building blocks offer a different interface to the users, e.g. a replicated hashmap
with puts and gets, or a distributed counter or lock.



[[ReplicatedStateMachine]]
=== ReplicatedStateMachine

`ReplicatedStateMachine` is a key-value store replicating its contents to all cluster members. Contrary to the JGroups
equivalent (`ReplicatedHashMap`), changes are replicated by consensus and logged to a persistent log.

While the JGroups version is allowed to make progress during network partitions, and users need to merge possibly
diverging state from different partitions after a partition heals, `ReplicatedStateMachine` will allow progress only in
the _majority partition_, so no state merging needs to be done after a partition heals.

Not having to merge state is certainly simpler, but comes at the expense of availability: if `N/2+1` members leave or
split into different partitions, `ReplicatedStateMachine` will be unavailable (all requests will time out).

However, the advantage is that the members' states will never diverge.

`ReplicatedStateMachine` requires a `JChannel` in its constructor and has `put()`, `get()` and `remove()` methods.
The code below shows how to create an instance of `ReplicatedStateMachine` and add an element to it:

[source,java]
----
protected void start(String raft_id) throws Exception {
    JChannel ch=new JChannel("raft.xml").name(raft_id);
    ReplicatedStateMachine<String,String> rsm=new ReplicatedStateMachine<>(ch);
    rsm.raftId(raft_id);
    ch.connect("rsm-cluster");
    rsm.put("name", "Bela");
}
----

There's a demo `ReplicatedStateMachineDemo` which can be used to interactively use `ReplicatedStateMachine`.




[[CounterService]]
=== CounterService

`CounterService` provides a replicated counter which can get be set, get and compare-and-set, implementing JGroups'
`Counter` interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface Counter {
    public long    get();
    public void    set(long new_value);
    public boolean compareAndSet(long expect, long update);
    public long    incrementAndGet();
    public long    decrementAndGet();
    public long    addAndGet(long delta);
}
----

A `Counter` implementation is created via the `CounterService` building block (edited):

[source,java]
----
public class CounterService implements StateMachine {
    public CounterService(Channel ch);
    public long           replTimeout();
    public CounterService replTimeout(long timeout);
    public boolean        allowDirtyReads();
    public CounterService allowDirtyReads(boolean flag);
    public CounterService raftId(String id);

    /**
     * Returns an existing counter, or creates a new one if none exists
     * @param name Name of the counter, different counters have to have different names
     * @param initial_value The initial value of a new counter if there is no existing counter.
     * Ignored if the counter already exists
     * @return The counter implementation
     */
    public Counter getOrCreateCounter(String name, long initial_value) throws Exception;


    /**
     * Deletes a counter instance (on the coordinator)
     * @param name The name of the counter. No-op if the counter doesn't exist
     */
    public void deleteCounter(String name) throws Exception;
}
----

`CounterService` is mainly used to get an existing or create a new `Counter` implementation (`getOrCreateCounter()`), or
to delete an existing counter (`deleteCounter()`).

To create an instance of `CounterService`, a JChannel has to be passed to the constructor. The sample code below
shows how to use this:

[source,java]
----
protected void start(String raft_id) throws Exception {
    JChannel ch=new JChannel("raft.xml").name(raft_id);
    CounterService cs=new CounterService(ch);               // <1>
    ch.connect("counter-cluster");
    Counter counter=cs.getOrCreateCounter("mycounter", 1);  // <2>
    counter.incrementAndGet();                              // <3>
    counter.compareAndSet(2, 5);                            // <4>
    long current_value=counter.get();                       // <5>
}
----
<1> First a `CounterService` is created and given a reference to a channel
<2> Once the member has joined the cluster, we create a counter named "mycounter" with an initial value of 1
<3> The counter is then incremented to 2
<4> Now a compare-and-set operation sets the counter to 5 if it was 2
<5> The last operation fetches the current value of "mycounter"


Any member in the cluster can change the same counter and all operations are ordered by the Raft leader, which causes
the replicated counters to have exactly the same value in all members.

Comparing this to the JGroups equivalent, a jgroups-raft counter never diverges in different members, again at the
expense of availability. In the JGroups version, counters are always available, but may diverge, e.g. in a split brain
scenario, and have to be reconciled by the application after the split brain is resolved.

There's a demo `CounterServiceDemo` which can be used to interactively manipulate replicated counters.


==== Reads and consensus

Currently (as of jgroups-raft version 0.2), reading a counter is by default _dirty_, meaning that a read may return a
stale value.

This can be changed by calling `counter_service.allowDirtyReads(false)`.

However, this inserts a dummy _read log entry_ which returns the value of counter when committed. Since this dummy entry
is ordered correctly wrt writes in the log, it will always return correct values.

The cost is that reads take up space in the persistent logs and that we need consensus (majority) for reads. In the next
release of jgroups-raft, the mechanism for client reads as suggested in the Raft paper will be implemented. See
https://github.com/belaban/jgroups-raft/issues/18[Issue 18] for details.

NOTE: Non-dirty reads has not yet been implemented in `ReplicatedStateMachine`.
