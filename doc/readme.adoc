RAFT in JGroups
===============

Goals
-----
. Implement the RAFT consensus protocol in JGroups
. Provide an API to RAFT
. Implement etcd (?) [API and REST interface]
. ZooKeeper impl using etcd impl (?)


Advantages of using JGroups as basis for a RAFT impl
----------------------------------------------------
* Transports already available: UDP, TCP
** Contains thread pools, priority delivery (OOB), batching etc
* Variety of discovery protocols
* Encryption, authentication, compression
* Fragmentation, reliability over UDP
* Multicasting for larger clusters
* Failure detection
* Sync/async cluster RPC


Design overview
---------------
* Raft building block over a channel
** Communicates with RAFT protocol via events (like COUNTER or CENTRAL_LOCK)


Design issues
-------------
* Separate protocols for
** Leader election
*** Could be omitted as JGroups already has a leader
*** Majority partition makes progress
** Log replication
** Log safety
** Client interaction
* These protocols would communicate via events
* Heartbeat is not needed for failure detection, but only for log replication
  and log safety


Misc
----
* Seperate GitHub project for now for RAFT protocol and building block
** May be moved into JGroups once it is stable
** But for now, with a separate project we can release quickly and independently
* Separate project for etcd consuming RAFT and JGroups ?
* Mailing list on google
** Potential contributors from Lyon and Newcastle uni (MarkL)
