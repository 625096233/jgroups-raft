= Minutes RAFT meeting Milano Nov 19 2014 (Ugo, Fabio, Tristan, Bela)

== RAFT in JGroups
* 3 protocols: RAFT, ELECTION and HARTBEAT
* Implementation pretty close to the paper
* 2nd stage:
** ELECTION and HEARTBEAT replaced by JGroups heartbeat (see readme.adoc)
*** Heartbeat is done by JGroups anyway -> less traffic
*** Election triggered by JGroups view change
*** See readme.adoc / design.adoc
* Interfaces `Log` and `StateMachine` have to be hashed out
** `Log` will be implemented by Ugo, posibly using LevelDB or JDBM2
** Fabio looking at Jube and its use of etcd
*** Goal: implementation of etcd on top of RAFT/JGroups


== RAFT in Infinispan
* Is consensus needed ? If so, where ?
* Comparison of total order protocol against consensus
** Locks, counters
** More discussion needed in Berlin Feb 2015 (Pedro, Tristan, Dan)

== Chunks of work
* A Log implementation based on LevelDB / JDBM2 (Apache DS) [Ugo]
* etcd impl [Fabio]
** Use of etcd in Fabric8 to understand how they use it
** Goal: use JGroups based etcd in Jube, or standalone
* ZooKeeper impl (?)
** Curator framework
*** Master election
*** Locks
* Perf tests
* Correctness proofs

== Next steps
* Define the `Log` and `StateMachine` interfaces [Bela, Ugo, Fabio]
* Look at etcd (interface, REST code in Jube and use in Jube) [Fabio]
** `RAFT_CLIENT` protocol (or building block) to provide a REST interface for etcd ?
* Look at LevelDB and/or JDBM2 to write a persistent `Log` impl [Ugo]
